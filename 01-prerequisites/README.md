# Prerequisites

Before building your MCP server, you need Node.js installed.

## Requirements

| Requirement | Version | Check Command |
|-------------|---------|---------------|
| Node.js | v20 or later | `node --version` |
| npm | v10 or later | `npm --version` |

## Choose Your Track

- **Engineers**: Follow [ENGINEER.md](./ENGINEER.md) for step-by-step installation
- **Non-Engineers**: Follow [NON-ENGINEER.md](./NON-ENGINEER.md) for a Cursor prompt that checks and guides you

## Quick Check

Run this in your terminal:

```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

If both show version numbers, you're ready. Continue to [02-mcp-basics](../02-mcp-basics/).

If not, follow the instructions in your track's guide.
