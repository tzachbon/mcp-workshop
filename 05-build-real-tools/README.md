# Build Real Tools

Now that you can create and connect MCP servers, let's build something useful.

## The Project: Airtable Integration

Build an MCP server that interacts with Airtable:
- `list-records` - List records from a table
- `get-record` - Get a single record
- `create-record` - Create new records

**Why Airtable?**
- Real-world authentication with API keys
- Teaches environment variable handling
- Practical business tool integration
- Shows CRUD operations

**Prerequisites:**
- Free Airtable account
- Personal Access Token (we'll show you how to get one)

## Choose Your Track

- **Engineers**: Follow [airtable/ENGINEER.md](./airtable/ENGINEER.md) for step-by-step implementation
- **Non-Engineers**: Follow [airtable/NON-ENGINEER.md](./airtable/NON-ENGINEER.md) for a ready-to-use prompt

## What You'll Learn

- Making HTTP requests from MCP tools
- Working with API keys securely
- Environment variable configuration
- Cursor MCP environment variables
- Handling API responses
- Error handling
- Schema design for inputs/outputs

## Working Example

Check the `examples/airtable/` folder in the workshop root for a complete, working implementation.
