[{"id":0,"title":"Introduction to MCP","content":"#\n\n\nWhat is MCP?#\n\nMCP (Model Context Protocol) is an open standard that defines how AI assistants\ncommunicate with external tools and data sources. It acts as a bridge between AI\nmodels (like Claude, GPT) and the real world.\n\nThink of it like this:\n\n * Without MCP: AI can only respond based on its training data\n * With MCP: AI can fetch live data, call APIs, read files, query databases\n\n\nHow MCP Works#\n\n\n\n 1. Client (Cursor, Claude Desktop): The AI assistant that wants to use tools\n 2. Server (Your code): Exposes tools the AI can call\n 3. Transport: How they communicate (stdio for local servers)\n\n\nKey Concepts#\n\n\nTools#\n\nFunctions the AI can call. Each tool has:\n\n * A name (e.g., get-pokemon)\n * A description (what it does)\n * Input schema (what parameters it accepts)\n * Output schema (what it returns)\n\n\nResources#\n\nStatic or dynamic data the AI can read (like files or database records).\n\n\nPrompts#\n\nPre-defined templates for common interactions.\n\n\nWhy MCP Matters#\n\nBEFORE MCP                             WITH MCP\nEvery AI tool integration was custom   Standardized protocol everyone can use\nVendors locked in their integrations   Open ecosystem of tools\nHard to extend AI capabilities         Easy to add new tools\n\n\nWhat You'll Build#\n\nIn this workshop, you'll create MCP servers that:\n\n 1. Hello World - A simple greeting tool (learn the basics)\n 2. Airtable - Interact with Airtable (with authentication)\n\nBy the end, you'll understand how to turn any API into an MCP tool that Cursor\ncan use.\n\n\nNext Step#\n\nContinue to 01-prerequisites to set up your environment.","routePath":"/00-introduction/README","lang":"","toc":[{"text":"What is MCP?","id":"what-is-mcp","depth":2,"charIndex":3},{"text":"How MCP Works","id":"how-mcp-works","depth":2,"charIndex":391},{"text":"Key Concepts","id":"key-concepts","depth":2,"charIndex":605},{"text":"Tools","id":"tools","depth":3,"charIndex":621},{"text":"Resources","id":"resources","depth":3,"charIndex":816},{"text":"Prompts","id":"prompts","depth":3,"charIndex":903},{"text":"Why MCP Matters","id":"why-mcp-matters","depth":2,"charIndex":962},{"text":"What You'll Build","id":"what-youll-build","depth":2,"charIndex":1232},{"text":"Next Step","id":"next-step","depth":2,"charIndex":1514}],"domain":"","frontmatter":{},"version":""},{"id":1,"title":"Prerequisites (Engineer Track)","content":"#\n\n\nInstalling Node.js#\n\n\nmacOS#\n\nOption 1: Official Installer\n\n 1.
